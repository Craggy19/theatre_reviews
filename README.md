# Theatre Review

This site is for all to use. You can view shows that others have seen and see what they had to say about them. 

For a more interactive experience you can Register and add your own thoughts about your own experiences at the theatre, whether they are in London or your own local theatres.

The site allows users to Create, Read, Update and Delete any shows they have input themselves. They can also read what others have written but cannot alter them in any way.

## UX

![alt text](static/images/screensizes.PNG)

There are so many Theatres throughout the UK that it would be impossible to search each one individually. This site would make that much easier. The search facility will help you look up a show you would like to see and check on other peoples opinions on the show. You could also look for inspiration for something new for you to see.

Visitors to the site can:

* View shows that have been added.
* Read reviews that have been written.
* Search for shows.
* Register an account for free.
* Login (if already registered).
* Logout of my account

Registered members can:

* View shows that have been added.
* Read reviews that have been written.
* Search for shows.
* Login.
* Create new shows they have seen.
* Update or Edit shows they have added.
* Delete shows they have added.

There is also an Admin Login which allows the owner to add, edit or delete genres where necessary.

## Wireframes

I used Balsamiq for my wireframes and showed each page as a monitor size, a tablet size and a mobile phone size.

## Layout

I chose the background for my site as it shows the inside of a theatre and it gve me the ideas for the colour scheme. 

The colours I used best depicted the theatre and the usual colour of the curtain in front of a stage.

I chose the typography as a warm and fun font that I found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
I felt it suited the layout of the pages. I used it as the main header for the site and also on the headings of each individual page.

## Images

The Background I used is of Edinburgh Festival Theatre and the image itself was taken from Google images and the actual image came from Time Out magazine. [Background Image.](https://www.timeout.com/edinburgh/theatre/edinburgh-festivals-2015-theatre-reviews)
